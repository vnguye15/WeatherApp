# WeatherApp
This Weather App allows users to type in any zip code, city, state, and country. In return the user will receive information such as current temperature, sunset time, humidity, wind speeds, etc.
The data is achieved through using OpenWeatherMap API's. Innovative features includes floating icons when hovered over, background changes to replicate Day/Night, and a unique specialized sunset time responsive to the area searched.
